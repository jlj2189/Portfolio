  <h1 style="color: green; font-family: script; text-align: center;"> What does a Buds001 like to Eat?</h1>
<br>
<p font-family: Lobster;>
  Buds001 is a tough cookie when it comes to food. He likes his formula but he does not want to hold the bottle.
  He likes his food but only sometimes.  It has been a journey to the the Buds001 up to speed but he should
  be close to at least expectations to qualify as a BudsPrime.
