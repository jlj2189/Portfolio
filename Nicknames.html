  <h1 style="text-align: center; color:red;">Nicknames List</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 25px"><strong>As a first step to becoming a Buds prime he
  must have at least 20 nicknames.  These Nicknames
can be whatever the mood, action, and quirk the Buds in training
is exhibiting.</strong></p>
<br>
<h2>Here is our example list for our current Buds001:</h2>
<div class="column">
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Tony"Butts"</strong>- developed by a gangster show and everyone in the family needed one</li>
   <li>Burt Burt - an action in which the Buds001 sits and makes no noise</li>
   <li>Schmoopy - when the Buds showing signs of boredom and proceeds to whine</li>
  <li>Ardy din din - a name in which the baby is ready to eat but still wanting him to understand his real name</li>
   <li>'Lil'Ardy - only used by uncles because he is training.</li>
   <li>Sunshine - a classic by any standard typical used by the grandmothers</li>
   <li>Bubba - usually used at any point in the day amongst the many other names </li>
   <li>Budson - when you get an island on animal crossing and Buds001 gains said
   island in order to make sense of his Daily Poopy Numbers (courtesty Hungry Catepiller bath book)</li>
 </ol>
</div>
<div class="row">
 <h5>And the list goes on. It may sound excessive to have over 20 Nicknames
 but they add up quick.  Especially when you add up the ones that seem to
 be innate to any human being</h5>
 <ul>
   <li>My love</li>
   <li>Booples</li>
   <li>Kiddo</li>
   <li>Little Fella</li>
 </ul>
