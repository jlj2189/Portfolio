      Welcome! Today I will be blogging about our son Ardyn. He has come into our lives
      and turned it upside down in the best way possible.  Don't get me wrong it
      can be hard at times but we have honestly had a revitalization in our creativity
      and in ourselves.  Now just to get into it what is a Buds Prime... A Buds Prime is when
      the Ardyn turns 1 and has met the required steps as a Buds001. Now there
      are many steps a Buds001 must complete or meet expectations to proceed to Buds Prime.
      These steps would be nicknames, playtime, eating, milestones, development,
      car rides, and interactions.

Below you will find quick links to jump right into and have a little glimpse in
a day and life with the Ardyn:
